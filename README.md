Many advantages of this is that you are anonymous to anyone; you can search and find a lot more things that you want.
Many disadvantages is that you can be anonymous as post anything; buy anything from anywhere; contact illegal people(i.e Hitmen) and also share explicit illegal content(i.e Child Porn);terrorist attacks(planning them) and much more
