```
One risk of the TOR network is that illegal activities, such as illegal trade and paedophilia, can be commited without the user being tracked. This makes it difficult for the police to locate the perpetrators of the illegal activity and bring them to justice. Letting these criminals get away with these crimes will make them feel more confident to commit more crimes which can cause harm to people's lives. For example, the selling of illegal weapons means that the buyers of these weapons can then phyasically harm people. The network can also be used for copyrgiht infringement of data, and transer of dangerous software. This software may be used for ilegal activities, and may be used to copy, delete or move protected files, such as government files without trace.
  A benfit of the network is that if you don't want your activity to be tracked for privacy reasons, you can use the network to avoid tracking. It can be used by whistle blowers who can complain about humans rights issues to release any information that may be about their government, without them being tracked to be prosecuted for releasing such information. This may be used in communists states, where the government controls all the media, and this is the only way to get your ideas out without being tracked, and your ideas being taken down.
