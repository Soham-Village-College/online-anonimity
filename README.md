This network has been deliberately been made to make it so you are anonymous to other people trying to track you. However this gives a lot of drawbacks because it gives people the freedom to do whatever they want on the web without being caught. Therefore TOR browser can encourage people to commit a crime, for example paedophilia, TOR networking is monitored by the government but it doesn’t show who is doing a certain thing and are very hard to track. However the TOR network gives some benefits in the sense that people are not being traced for what they are doing on the web which would of been blocked by websites like google because they would be censored. The cons override the pros of this network because it is giving the people using the web a sense of too much freedom and that what they are doing is up to them but they sometimes do not take this responsibly. For example the ‘dark web’ is used, this is the worse side of the internet which doesn’t act as the normal internet would because it is not monitored because they are on a TOR network
