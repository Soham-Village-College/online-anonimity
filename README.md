When you create a network such as this you run the risk of allowing criminal activity on it as criminals will be harder to track on it and this is something that has already happened as pedophiles use these networks to distribute illegal material across the web. These networks can also benefit people as it allows people who live in oppressive societies to access the web without there government being able to track them or halt their distribution of information. It could also help people who are being constantly bombarded across the web to get anonymity so they can access the web normally.
