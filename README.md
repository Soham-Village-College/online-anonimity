online-anonymity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR network is a program that allows internet users to browse anomalously. It uses many servers as relays to do this and slows down connection speed. Since the majority of the clear internet is monitired by governments, many people have opted to used this, not because they are doing something wrong, but because they don't want to be spyed on - the government doesn't have a reason for spying on them.

TOR has many disadvantages, as with anything, it can be abused for purposes other than its original intentions. Since users are anomalous on TOR, illegal activity is a worrying concern on TOR. Paedophiles are given a place where they can trade images and talk to each other without their identities being known. Websites such as Silk Road can trade almost anything without any users being identified. This is obviously a major problem for governments as illegal activity is happening but they can't find out who's doing it. Despite its problems,TOR still serves its original purpose - to provide online anonimity to those who need it. The internet in many communist states is controlled and real worldwide news is hidden, they place filterson the internet so the real news isn't seen. TOR allows users to bypass these filters and see the real news. Many governments monitor the clear web and even if a user isn't committing a crime they can be watched. It comes down to a simple matter of not wanting to be seen on the web because there is no reason for the government to be spying on you without probable cause.
