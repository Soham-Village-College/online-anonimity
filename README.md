```The TOR network is a service set up by a group of internet hackers to give people anonymity when on the internet. To do this it sends your information through multiple servers to make it hard to track the person online. This means that people cannot be tracked through the internet and so other people cannot see what you are doing.

Discuss the risks and benefits of such a network. (6 marks)

```The TOR network can be used for many good things but also many bad things as well. Some of the bad things that come from the Tor network are the sharing of illegal images and other illegal items. Also it can be used by people who want, will or have broken the law so that they cannot be found for example: paedophiles and thieves. It can also be used for selling illegal items and possible human trafficking. However some of the things it can be used for are good, for instance it could be used for people who are famous to stop people tracking them. Also it could be used by people in, say, a fascist dictatorship that has had information hidden from them, they could go on the TOR network and find out about this. It could also be used by people if they were looking at their bank details to make sure no one can find them.
