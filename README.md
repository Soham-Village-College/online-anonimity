online-anonymity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR (The Onion Router) network is a way of browsing the web almost completely anonamously.
To do this the connection is bounced around the world through volunteer's computers until finally reaching the webpage.
There are also several websites that can only be acessed through TOR such 
as the recently shut down Silk Road, where people could buy and sell illegal items.

```
One benefit of TOR is that people who are worried about being hacked or spied on by the government can use the network to increase their safety online. Another is that if a government of a country is a very oppressive one and want to supress information, users of TOR can browse the web freely. However TOR can also be used for malicious purposes, such as for acess of the "Dark/Deep web", websites that can only be acessed through TOR. These websites are often malicious and illegal and used for purposes such as distribution child abuse pictures and other media. TOR can also be used by terrorist orginisations to communicate instantly without being traced by the government.
