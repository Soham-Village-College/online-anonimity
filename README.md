TOR allows user anonymity, governemts have been constantly spying on the online population to get information and to catch criminals. User awareness of this spying has been increased and are more likely to use TOR, which will stop any spying happening. This is good if you are trying to stay out of the spotlight of the government for completely legal activites. However, more nefarious activities can also take place in the dark. Using TOR as a shield, cyber criminals may use the web to distribute, download, buy and sell illegal items or contraband.  TOR has become popualar with the paedophile community, which uses the anonymity tool to become inpeneterable to being prosecuted for their activites.
