```
One risk of the TOR network is that illegal activities, such as illegal trade and paedophilia, can be commited without the user being tracked. This makes it difficult for the police to locate the perpetrators of the illegal activity and bring them to justice. Letting these criminals get away with these crimes will risk the mto commit more crimes which can cause harm to people's lives. For example, the selling of illegal weapons means that the buyers of these weapons can then phyasically harm people. The network can also be used for copyrgiht infringement of data, and transer fo dangerous software.
  A benfit of the network is that if you don't want your activity to be tracked for privacy reasons, you canuse the network to avoid tracking. It can be used by whistle blowers who can complain about humans rights issues to release any information that may be about their government, without them being tracked to be prosecuted for releasing such information.
