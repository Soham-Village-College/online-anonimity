online-anonimity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR network is a program that allows internet users to browse anomalously. It uses many servers as relays to do this and slows down connection speed. Since the majority of the clear internet is monitired by governments, many people have opted to used this, not because they are doing something wrong, but because they don't want to be spyed on - the government doesn't have a reason for spying on them.

```
TOR has many disadvantages, as with anything, it can be abused for purposes other than its original intentions. Since users are anomalous on TOR, illegal activity is a worrying concern on TOR. Paedophiles are given a place where they can trade images and talk to each other without their identities being known.
