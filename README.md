online-anonymity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The tor network allows users of the internet to have anonymity online. It works by relaying your search on the internet through loads of computers, often hundreds, this makes it extremley hard to trace where the signal has come from as they will have to go back through all of the computers to get to you.

When technolgy is created, there will always be risks and benefits asscoiated with it, as its the way that people use it that makes the difference. This is the same with the Tor network, it has many benefits and many risks. Some benefits of online anonymity is that you can organise a protest against your government who may be strict on protests, an example of this is China who are strict on protests, an example being Tiananmen square. Another benefit is just to have the freedom of not being spyed on by the CIA when browsing as people have the right to internet freedom. 

However as i mentioned before there are also a lot of risks associated with Tor, one being that it grants you access to the dark web. The dark web is operated in a secretive way and is often involved in the movement of pedophiles and drugs. An example being Silk road (which was recently shut down) that was like the other half of ebay, which let people by drugs and guns. And being on the dark web it meant that people had online anonymity, so therefore couldn't be traced. Another risk is that it allows crimnals to commuicate with each other, this can be a risk as they could plot something or share infomation which could lead to robberys. Or it could be used by terrorists to plan attacks and relay infomation to one another without the authoritys knowing, which could lead to widespread attacks on civilians.
